  <p>  Locate the oil drain plug and put a drain pan underneath it.
       Unscrew the oil fill cap and let the oil drain.
       Once the oil is drained, put the cap back, making sure that you donâ€™t cross-thread it.
       Locate the oil filter.
       Move the oil drain pan underneath the filter.</p>
  
  <p>  Grab and twist the filter to remove.
       Wipe off the filter mounting surface using a clean cloth.
       Before installing the new filter, lubricate the gasket or rubber o-ring by putting a little fresh motor oil around it. 
       Use your hand to screw the filter on and tighten it until it makes contact with the engine block.
       Take a clean funnel and pour in the appropriate amount of fresh oil into the engine.
       Check the level of the oil and over the next few days, also check the filter and the drain plug for any leaks.</p>
